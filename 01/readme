	  \ |\/			First reversing problem
	   \|/
	    `
	Since inspecting the code was allowed the first thing i made was to undo the
	ofuscated code using vim you can do it easly by typing
		:%s/;/;\r/g

	Then fix the identation issues with the conditionals.
	After all that i just follwed the instructions was if i were the
	interpreter to end up with the conclussion that the password was
	always defined within the 'a' variable, you just need to skip all
	'9' characters and turn the numbers left into its ascii version.

	''.join([chr(int(a)) for a in "71948911191009749489669459759519121933".split('9')])
